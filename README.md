MORSE CODE 
A  brief review of what a Morse code is and the historical context of why Morse code was created:

Morse code is a method used in telecommuncation to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashe (or short and long signals). Invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830's for telegraph communication. Intially it used dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers transmitted over wires. This made long-distance communication easy,enabling rapid transmission of messages across cast distances. By the 19th century Morse code became standeard for telegraph communication used world wide for communication and personal messages. It's simplicity and speed made it essential for communication, particularly during times of war and emergency.

An explanation of how the Morse code system works, including the use of dots and dashes:

1. sender translates messages into Morse code
2. sender transmitts code using telegragh,radio,or other means.
3. reciever translates code back into original message.
   example of Morse code: A: .-- (dot-dash)
                          B: -... (dash-dot-dot-dot)
                          C: -.-. (dash-dot-dash-dot)
